The website to be used for The UBC Engineering Physics Student Association. Its uses include recent announcements, course directory, community events, related contacts, etc.

## Work Flow

##### Issue Distribution

When you are working on a task (an **issue**), assign that issue to yourself on the "Issues" tab. Do not work on an issue you have not assigned yourself, because this will eventually lead to two or more people working on the same issue without knowing that others are also working on it. This wastes both time and effort. If it happens, a game of rock-paper-scissors will take place to determine who gets to merge their version to the master branch (just kidding!).

##### Version Control

Always make your own branch when working on a task. **Do not** work on the master branch. When you are done with the task, make a pull request and ask someone else on the team to look it over before merging it with the master branch. This is essential for preserving functionality. 


## Code Organization

##### Server to be used

Has not yet been decided. Possibly AWS.

##### Database to be used

Has not yet been decided. 

##### Components

Every component should be organized into a folder that is named after that component's respective purpose. For example, the .css, .js, and any other related files to the home page that displays the landing banner, and announcements, should be placed inside a folder called "Home".

##### Naming convention 

The names of any **props, states, constants, variables, or arguments** should relate to their purpose in the code, to ensure readibility. 

##### Readibility

Any code you write should be readable for others on the team. This means that you should be liberal with spacing, indenting, and new lines.
