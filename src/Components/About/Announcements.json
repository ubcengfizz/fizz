      "Description":"Fizz Talks is currently in planning stages for early November! This is a once-per-semester event where Fizzers can get up in front of an audience, practice their performing or oratory skills and share some of their interests and passions. There's no real format to the performance or presentation you want to give, only that you're limited to 10 minutes. Interested in being a speaker? Send an email to president@ubcfizz.com with a short abstract of your talk, or what you plan to perform."

If you've never been to a Beef and Pizza before, this is your best opportunity to tell Andre how Engineering Physics could be better in terms of course scheduling and selection. "
