                        the Engineering Physics program, one of the most challenging programs here at
                        UBC.</span>

                        The Engineering Physics program has a
                        reputation for being… well…hard. But don’t ever let that scare you or deter
                        you. Many individuals before you have made it through the program and while
                        they are all self-declared masochists, it really isn’t that bad. In fact, it is
                        one of <b><i>the</i></b> most rewarding
                        programs offered here at UBC. The amount of knowledge you are going to gain is
                        considerable and the challenges you are about to face are large, but that is
                        part of what makes Engineering Physics so great. From solving complicated
                        problems, working abroad, or achieving personal bests, the academic journey you
                        are about to embark on has all the potential for being an incredible
                        experience. It may seem painful at times, but there are ways to lessen the
                        suffering and it will be worth it in the end.</span></div>
                    <div className="content"><span lang="EN-CA">
                        This survival guide is full of explanations
                        and tips of what the Engineering Physics program is and what being a Fizzer
                        means. It’ll also give you pointers on the different classes you have to take,
                        how to get that coop job you dreamed of, how to get into grad school, and best
                        of all, how to make the most of the whole experience.</span></div>

                        brave souls who have gone before you about Engineering Physics. The upper year

                        ecstatically about the good, what they should have done back then and what they
                        would do if they were you. With a grain of salt or two, you can gain a lot by
                        listening to them about their experiences. In addition, your executives are
                        there to make your academic journey not only less painful, but fun too. And
                        don’t forget your classmates, either; they’re probably one of the best
                        resources you’ll have, since they’ll be there alongside you taking the same
                        classes and working through the same problem sets.</span></div>

                    <h3><a name="TOC-What-is-Engineering-Physics-"></a>What is Engineering Physics? </h3>
                    &nbsp;<br />
                    <div className="content"><span lang="EN-CA">Well, you might struggle with when trying
                    to explain to people what it is that you’re studying in school. Essentially,
                    Engineering Physics is the bridge between Engineering and Science, where
                    scientific discoveries are converted into tools that engineers can use. The
                    program encourages team-based-project learning early on, teaches advanced
                    concepts in math and physics, and teaches how they are applied in mechanical,
                    electrical and computer engineering. The results are students with a broad set
                    of knowledge and work options.</span></div>
                    <div className="content">Engineering Physics is a cross-disciplinary
                    program that combines the best of both worlds: Know-How and Know-Why. You learn
                    the practical and technical skills of an engineer, as well as the theoretical
                    and analytical skills of a scientist. In other words, an Engineering Physics
                    graduate will be able to take the theory they learned and apply it to solve
                    novel (as opposed to routine) engineering problems.</div>
                    <div className="content">Engineering Physics is rather unique in
                    that it is considered one of the Engineering disciplines in Applied Science,
                    yet it operates out of the Physics and Astronomy Department under the umbrella
                    of Science. Confused? Yeah, me too, but it seems to work. This is also true for
                    Co-op – Eng Phys Co-op is run by the Science (not Engineering) Co-op office.</div>

        So what kind of things do you need to learn to become a real Fizzer? Well that depends on what you
        want
        to specialize in and what you want to focus on. Your 2nd year is cross-disciplinary and includes a
        number of Physics, Math, and Engineering courses that provide the background you need for subsequent
        courses. Before registering for your 3rd year courses, during the summer of 2nd year, you will be
        asked
        to declare your specialization. Once again, you will not automatically be accepted into the
        specialization of your choice.&nbsp; There are limited seats available in the
        Mechatronics&nbsp;option
        and students will be ranked according to 2nd year marks. In your 4th and 5th years you’ll have the
        opportunity to choose technical electives and focus your studies on topics that interest you most.
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Below are short nuggets of wisdom, passed on to you from current/recent Fizz
        students, about each class that you’ll take. However, you’ll notice that the some of the courses
        from
        5th year are missing. This is because the curriculum is changing, and we don’t know yet what courses
        your class will have to take in your 5th year. When you look at the UBC Calendar or Eng Phys Dept.
        website, the classes currently listed for 5th year are the classes that the current 5th years have
        to
        take, and they may not all be the same as what you’ll be taking three years from now. However, the
        courses listed are ones that have been part of the curriculum for quite some, and are not likely to
        change.

        &nbsp;“I generally believe that for most "high-end" technical jobs (research scientist, research
        engineer, <br />
        part of an engineering team developing unconventional new products etc.), you can't have too <br />
        much math background. Once you get to a threshold in math knowledge, where you feel <br />
        confident about tackling most any well-defined physics or engineering problem that might come <br />
        your way, there is no turning back. Having said this, the math requirements in Eng Phys should <br />
        be sufficient to get you to this threshold. Thus there is absolutely no question that you are better
        <br />
        off doing very well in the existing core program, than taking extra math courses and doing <br />
        considerably worse in everything you take. There are a few very gifted people who seem to be <br />
        able to take the math honours and still do fantastically well in the whole program. It is students
        <br />
        that seem to have that potential that I really encourage to take math honours, after pointing out
        <br />
        what I just mentioned.”&nbsp; <br />

        Many times we learn new Math in our physics class prior to learning it in our math class. Math is
        such a
        crucial part of Eng Phys that all of us fizzers have to take Math 400. Rumour has it that this is
        considered the hardest undergraduate applied math course at UBC. Some words of advice passed down
        from
        the higher Fizzers is to ensure you never fall behind in learning the Math. The impression is that
        the
        only way to pass Math 400 is to do well in all the previous math courses.&nbsp; <br />

        need
        3 extra courses. The accounting one is very simple, and useful if you have never taken Accounting
        before. The marketing course proves to be quite practical as well.&nbsp; For the elective, the

        not
        technically mandatory. The whole point is to gain practical, technical experience and although co-op
        is
        a great way to do this, it isn’t the only way (see Co-Op Alternatives, a few pages
        ahead).&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Following are some tips on how to land a co-op placement and some alternatives to gaining technical
        experience through other work and projects. <br />
        &nbsp;<br />
                            <h3><a name="TOC-Getting-a-Co-op-Job"></a>
            Getting a Co-op Job </h3><i>
                                By Sandy Abley, former Eng Phys Co-op Coordinator </i><br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        • Get your resume and cover letter checked by the Coordinator and if possible get it checked over
        and
        revised BEFORE school starts in Sept. Due to competition with other universities we are starting to
        post
        jobs earlier and earlier.&nbsp; <br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        • If you have sent out 20 applications and have no interviews, this is a sign that something is
        wrong
        with your application, get it checked <br /><br />
                        </div>
                        <div>• Do NOT be picky about what you will do. If this is your first "real" job, you need to get
                        EXPERIENCE
        and contacts. And sometimes the most valuable experiences are the unexpected ones. <br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        • Work hard...no matter what you are doing or your level of responsibility. People will remember
        you.
        Even though you are a student, you are establishing your reputation. <br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        • Be kind and respectful to everyone you meet and your classmates...they are your future colleagues
        and
        perhaps future business owners/partners. <br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        • Good formatting and well written cover letters DO help you land interviews.&nbsp;<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        • Try to apply to at least 5 to 10 jobs a week - those who try hard will eventually find a job. It's
        extremely rare for someone who has worked hard NOT to get a job. <br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        • Visit the Co-op coordinator at least once a week if you are still searching for job. This keeps
        you on
        top of mind and shows you really care about your job search. Almost all students who do this are
        extremely successful. <br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        • If you need help, ask for it. Everyone wants to see you succeed. <br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        • MOCK interviews. Book at least one mock interview...it can really make a difference. <br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        • During your first week on the job, sit down and talk to your direct supervisor about his/her
        expectations and goals for your work term. This will give you some direction and establish that you
        care
        about getting the job done right. <br />

                            <br /><i>By Sandy Abley, former Eng Phys Co-op Coordinator </i><br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        Why are you there? What is your purpose? If it’s to do some research and networking, then have
        questions
        ready. Come prepared. If it’s to find a job, come prepared with many copies of your resume and be
        ready
        to be interviewed on the spot. <br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        For example, when I was at the Microsoft booth a couple of years ago, they did not want you to leave
        your resume and run. They take your resume and screen you on the spot. And they were taking notes
        right
        on the spot on your resume. You are already being short-listed as you stand there! If you just leave
        your resume there and walk away without talking to the recruiter, you are wasting paper. <br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        Questions they asked: <br />
        • When are you graduating? <br />
        • What do you want to do? Be really specific. Give them lots of choices. <br />
        • What’s the coolest thing on your resume? (Don’t make them ask why!) <br />
        • What are you excited about? <br />
        • What makes your program better than _________. (You and I know that your program is great...but
        you
        must know how to effectively market YOUR program). You are the ambassadors for the Engineering
        Physics
        Program! <br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        What they are looking for: <br />
        • Interest and enthusiasm <br />
        • ‘A shine in your eyes’ or a glazed look over your face? <br />
        • A friendly person with excellent communication skills <br />
        • Smiles, a sense of humour <br />
        • Maturity <br />
        • Confidence (remember it’s in your body language and in your voice) <br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        What are positive things you can do? <br />
        • Dress appropriately nice shirt or golf shirt and nice pants leave your skate board and roller
        blades
        at home <br />
        • Ask intelligent questions about the company <br />
        • Politely ask for company information <br />
        • Do not simply drop off your resume and run off! The whole point of being there is so that they can
        put
        a face to a resume. You’re wasting your time and theirs otherwise you could<br />
        have just faxed or e-mailed them your resume. <br />
        • Make yourself shine above others. (ie. Bring brochures about Eng Phys), tell them about your goals
        (you don’t just want junior positions forever) talk about your desire to become <br />
        a project manager, etc <br />
        • A firm hand shake <br />
        • Look at people straight in the eye! <br />
        • Be a great ambassador for yourprogram. Don’t assume these people know how great and&nbsp;selective
        your program is! <br />
                            <br /><br />

                        </div>
                        <div>The easiest choice of action if you don’t get a co-op job is to take classes, however there are a
        couple of alternatives: <br /><br /><b>Entrepreneurial Co-op&nbsp;</b></div>
                        <div>This is similar to regular co-op in that it is paid work, but different in that much more work and
                        effort is necessary compared to a regular job. This alternative has more freedom but requires more
                        responsibility as it is self-moderated. You have to make a business plan and budget, find sponsors
                        and
                        customers for the good or service you intend to provide, as well as developing the product itself.
                        This
                        is much more difficult compared to a regular co-op job, however, the experience could be very
                        rewarding.
        For more information contact the Co-op Coordinator. <br /><br /><br />
        
        <b>Technical Experience</b></div>
                        <div>Similar in scope to the Project Lab projects, you choose a project and write a big report after
                        several
                        months of work…usually unpaid. The good part is this would require only as much work as a regular
                        work
                        term and you get some choice as to what project you work on. For more information see Jon Nakane
                        about projects and sponsor companies. <br /><br /><br />
        
        <b>Opting Out of Co-op</b></div>
                        <div>Although there are alternatives to completing co-op, students are strongly encouraged to
                        participate in
        the coop program to gain technical and industry experience. Opting out of the <br />Engineering
        Physics
        Co-op program is possible, however you must still fulfill technical experience requirements. This
        includes working for at least 8 months of work in an engineering <br />related field, and/or
        completing an industry sponsored project in ENPH 459, ENPH 479 or APSC 486*.
        <br /><br />* APSC 486 is known as New Venture Design, an additional project course regular
        Engineering students have the option of taking. It may replace ENPH 479 or it could count as a tech elective &nbsp;<br />

                            <h3><a name="TOC-Grad-School"></a>Grad School </h3>You may or may not have thought about continuing
        with
        Grad School yet, but keep in mind that your 3rd Year marks will help. <br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        Rumour has it there are a few ways to get into Grad School: <br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        • Maintain good grades – Keep an average above 80% in your 3rd and 4th year courses and have no W’s
        on
        your transcript (requirements may differ slightly depending on the school <br />
        you are applying to) <br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        • Don’t take an excessively long time to finish your degree <br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        • Have good research capabilities – This is well suited for someone in Engineering Physics since we
        are
        enrolled in a number of project courses, intensive labs and have a thorough <br />
        math and physics background. <br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        • Getting published – Not only is this helpful to getting into Grad School, it’s great for your
        résumé
        too. It shows your good capabilities to do research, and also shows your ability to <br />
        think creatively and put what you’ve learned to use. Getting published (as in a paper in a
        scientific
        journal of some kind) shows your ability to learn well in a more self-guided setting and is
        something
        prospective schools would certainly be looking for.&nbsp; Having said that, getting a paper
        published is
        no easy task. Most of the time the paper has to be refereed, or evaluated by a professional who must
        decide if the work is worth publishing. You may work on part of a project (for co-op or in the
        project
        lab) that is going to have publishable results, and your name may appear on the paper. If not, you
        may
        try to write a paper yourself and submit it to an undergraduate journal or competition (try Canadian
        Undergraduate Physics Journal, www.cupj.ca). For co-op, it may be possible to write your co-op
        report in
        the format of a scientific paper. <br />

                        <div><span >Research</span><br />UBC is really a great place to
        pursue
        graduate studies. There is an immense amount of research going on here! If you talk to the profs and
        look into it, you’ll find a number of Engineering <br />
        Physics grads in many corners of the university. Visit the engineering and physics websites, and
        scan
        the research topics for any thing that strikes you. <br />

        We are often told to focus on what we’re passionate about. All of us can and do excel at what we
        enjoy.
        Many of us fill our work terms (and for some, the rest of the school year) helping do
        research at UBC or abroad. Engineering Physics is a great program to help set you up for Grad School
        or
        even a future in research. The main problems are ‘I like every thing’ and ‘Who do I
        talk to if I want to learn more or get involved?’ <br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        You’re on your own if you like everything. As Fizzers we tend to be good at a lot of things but
        watch
        out for something that may stand out. <br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        As for getting connected, a great place to start is the web. Check out the research tabs on
        departmental
        and personal webpages to learn about what’s going on here at UBC. You might also talk to Dr. Young,
        Dr.
        Davis, Dr. Auld, and Dr. Marziali, but keep in mind all profs do research (although much of it may
        be
        theoretical physics). Also, talk to other students. Let everyone know what you’re interested in
        pursuing
        and someone may pass you a name to pursue. <br />

                            We’re smaller than clubs like Mech and Civil, but we’re also bigger than clubs
                            like GeoRox. Mix that in with brains, and Fizz is a unique club whose members
                            are not only academically successful, but are also diverse, social and show a
                            high level of camaraderie. You’ll also find Fizzers involved with the many
                            different clubs on campus, competing on all levels of intramural sports, or
                            sitting around an impromptu music jam session. Overall, Fizz is comprised of a
                            dynamic and well-rounded people with a wide variety of skills and backgrounds.

                Sometimes Fizz can be a lot to tackle on your own. Studying and working in pairs or groups
                can&nbsp;be really helpful because you can always ask your study buddy or buddies about
                something you&nbsp;don’t understand. What you could also try if you’re crunched for time is
                if
                you take the time to read one section of the text and your buddy takes the time to read a
                different one, you can explain it to each other, skip a bunch of reading and get a better
                understanding all around. You can really&nbsp;get a lot out of helping each other… but, the
                hard
                part, you got to keep focused on task! <br />
                &nbsp;<br /><b><i>
                                        Stay on top of things</i></b> <br />
                You’ve probably heard it before, and here it is again. It makes studying for exams and
                asking
                the right questions that much easier. It also really works to look at a problem set or
                homework
                assignment and chip away at it well ahead of the due date. This gives you more time to
                understand the problems and wrap your head around those sometimes somewhat abstract
                concepts.

                you
                are sane at the moment, here are some ways of keeping it through those few times during the
                year
                when things get a little hectic and a little, well, insane. Many of us spend so much time
                commuting to and from school, working on assignments, project and studying that we’re often
                left
                wishing to do more. There’s just simply more to life than school! <br />
                &nbsp;<br />
                It’s important to strike a balance in your mental, emotional and physical aspects of your
                well-being. You may even be able to regain that sanity you thought you had lost for good!

                                        Mentally </i></b><br />
                Study hard and learn what you’re taught thoroughly, but also take some time to enjoy a good
                book, listen/play music, or play computer/board game. It is amazing how much changing
                gears&nbsp;for a little bit, while still using the ol’ noggin, will make it easier to focus
                when
                you do get back to studying. <br />

                If you’re happy and feeling good, chances are you’re going to have more energy and patience
                than
                someone who isn’t, which are key when it comes to learning. If something’s bothering you,
                it’s
                probably fruitful to deal with the issue and then move on rather than trying to ignore it. A
                good ranting or whining session to a friend, an unsuspecting roommate, a fellow Fizzer, or
                even
                a piece of cheese may clear up your mind and lift your spirits. <br />

                A math and engineering convention was being held. On the train to the convention, there were
                both math majors and engineering majors. Each of the math majors had his/her own train
                ticket.
                But the Engineers had only ONE ticket for all of them. The math majors started laughing and
                snickering. The engineers ignored the laughter. Then, one of the engineers said, "Here comes
                the
                conductor". All of the engineers piled into the bathroom. The math majors were puzzled. The
                conductor came aboard and collected tickets from all the math majors. He went to the
                bathroom,
                knocked on the door, and said, "Tickets Please". An engineer stuck their only ticket under
                the
                door. The conductor took the ticket and left. A few minutes later, the engineers emerged
                from
                the bathroom. The math majors felt really stupid. On the way back from the convention, the
                group
                of math majors had ONE ticket for their group. They started snickering at the engineers, who
                had
                NO tickets amongst them. When the engineer lookout shouted, "Conductor coming!", all the
                engineers again piled into a bathroom. All of the math majors went into another bathroom.
                Then,
                before the conductor came on board, one of the engineers left the bathroom, knocked on the
                other
                bathroom, and said, "Ticket please." <br />
