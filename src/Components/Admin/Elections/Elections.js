Though I am relatively new to Fizz council, having only held the E-week rep position last year, I hope you can all agree that I handled the job with the enthusiasm and dedication that will translate perfectly into the presidential position. Some of you may know how much I love Fizz and everyone in it. This is one of the main reasons I have decided to run for president. I want to do whatever I can in leading Fizz through the coming year to help make everyone lives as wonderful as possible. From the potential of overseeing the transition back to the OG Penthouse, to participating in yet another E-week and Advocating for Fizz student interests with faculty staff and the EUS, I am excited for everything the role entails.<br></br><br></br>Please considering voting for me for your next Fizz council President.

I am really passionate about bringing my ideas to council, and helping students access resources on common courses, as well as express opinions and improvements for future years. <br></br><br></br>A common challenge with Beef and Pizza, one of the most important ways we are able to gain feedback and a primary responsibility of the Board of Studies rep, has been to cohesively hear everyone’s opinions on time. This year I made sure that the second years had the opportunity to express their opinions on all courses by organizing a second Beef and Pizza with Andre and the council presidents. I believe I have the skills and experience needed to make a great Board of Studies rep and make improvements to academics in Fizz.<br></br><br></br>All that being said, if you have any cool course/tech elective ideas, I would love to work with you on suggesting them to Andre. I look forward to ensuring that we continue to get the most out of our Fizz degrees !!</div>

I'm always willing to listen and eager to help out, and I will ensure that Andre and the rest of our profs have sufficient feedback on how you feel about their courses. I look forward to advocating for your interests on the Board of Studies.</div>

I'm running for third year representative because I'm straightforward, honest and am committed to being a loyal voice to the third year fizzers. Some of my plans include additional tutorial sessions for difficult classes, increasing involvement from the third year student body, adding activities to help de-stress students during midterms and finals season (like dogs,) and third-year only clothing/merch. More importantly, my ears are open and I'm always willing to listen to new suggestions and ideas from you! #Vote4Vic </div>

Well, come to the penthouse any time between 8AM and 8AM the next day and I’ll be there to talk. It is never hard to find me when you want to make suggestions about courses and our program. A successful third year rep is the one that can have his voice heard, and I can make sure that the only thing the council hears for the 8 month term is “council its Lewis we need to talk”. I want us to have a powerful voice for the unique ideas we can come up with that will shape the future of FIZZ. I live by the wisdom that a wise man once told me, “seize the moment” – Ahmad.
